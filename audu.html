            <h1>AUDU</h1>
            <p>Our <strong>IAT387 Directed Studies</strong> project involved designing a specialized breathing apparatus. Our team had skills and interests in visual, interactive, user experience design and 3D modeling in software <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>. Since our previous projects were usually dealt with in strict digital environments, we wanted this directed study project to explore the <strong>3D design field (industrial design)</strong> in a customer-facing project. Here's how we approached the project from start to finish.</p>
            <p><strong>Professor:</strong> Kenneth Zupan</p>
            <p><strong>Team Members:</strong><br><strong>Rishabh Johri</strong> ( Researcher, Business Guru, Ideator,  Prototype Finishing Lead )<br> <strong>Sarah Daniels</strong> ( Researcher, Visual Designer, Ideator, Prototype Assembly Lead)<br><strong>Qiaohui Xu</strong> ( Ideator, 3D Modelling God, Prototype Cutting & Trimming Lead )</p>

        <div class="projects_intro">
            <h1>Research & Ideation</h1>
            <p>We began by researching existing breathing apparatuses and their limitations. We also studied the medical conditions that require the use of breathing apparatuses and how they affect the patient's daily life.</p>
            
            <p>Based on our research, we brainstormed ideas for a new breathing apparatus that would address the limitations of existing devices. We sketched out several designs and discussed their feasibility.</p>

        <div class="projects_intro">
            <h1>3D Modeling & Physical Prototyping</h1>
            <p>Once we had a design concept, we started 3D modeling the breathing apparatus in software including Blender and Ultimaker Cura. We iterated on the design several times until we were satisfied with the form and function.</p>
            
            <p>After the digital design was complete, we used 3D printing to create physical prototypes of the breathing apparatus. We tested the prototypes for usability and comfort, making adjustments to the design as necessary.</p>

        <div class="projects_intro">
            <h1>User Testing & Finalizing the Design</h1>
            <p>We conducted user testing with users who require breathing apparatuses to gather feedback on the design's functionality and comfort. Based on the feedback, we made further adjustments to the design.</p>
            
            <p>Once we had a design that satisfied the user's needs, we finalized the design and created detailed 3D models and technical drawings for manufacturing.</p>

            <p>Our specialized breathing apparatus project showcases our ability to combine our skills in visual, interactive, and user experience design to create a product that addresses real-world problems. The project speaks to our ability to research, ideate, prototype, and iterate on a design until we achieve the desired outcome. My specific contribution to the project, including the digital 3D modeling and physical 3D printing of the prototypes, demonstrates my proficiency in 3D modeling and rapid prototyping techniques.</p>
