                    <h1>The Sunside - Spatial Design</h1>
                    <p>The Sunside in Holland Park was the <strong>IAT233 Spatial Design</strong> final project involved designing a walkway canopy pavilion. By learning the propagation-based parametric systems, we applied and explored parametric modelling systems in the <a href="https://www.grasshopper3d.com/">Rhino & Grasshopper</a>. Working with parametric modeling systems was challenging at first, but their power and flexibility make them a powerful design medium. Thanks to these tools, we can efficient iteration and rapid prototyping, enabling designers to quickly refine and perfect our ideas. The Sunside is the idea we beautifully materialized with <strong>parametric modeling in the spatial design</strong>.</p>

                    <h1>Research & Ideation</h1>
                    <p>According to the request, our pavilion aims to create a <strong>multi-functional space</strong> in which people can walk freely, communicate with friends, and enjoy the good weather. During the design process, we paid special attention to providing ample space and opportunities for <strong>interaction between people</strong>.</p>

                    <p>Moreover, we recognized that the <strong>pavilion itself</strong> can be an <strong>interactive medium</strong>, so in order to integrate an abstract sculpture into the overall design of the pavilion, we specially designed a unique display space for it. We designed the entire pavilion as a <strong>fluid whole</strong>, and by raising and rotating the walls surrounding the abstract sculptures by 90 degrees, we achieved an arched top.</p>

                        <h1>Study the Context</h1>
                        <p>To ensure a <strong>comprehensive understanding</strong> of the pavilion's context, we analysis considered a wide range of factors to gain insights into the unique context of the pavilion within Holland Park. This involved examining its precise location, assessing the <strong>surrounding elements</strong>, built environments, <strong>access paths</strong>, traffic patterns, and noteworthy location features like landmarks, terrain characteristics, and orientation.</p>

                        <p>By leveraging the resources of the <a href="https://cosmos.surrey.ca/external/">City of Surrey Mapping Online System</a>, along with Google Earth's 3D data and conducting on-site field research, we conducted a detailed analysis of Holland Park. Through the combination of <strong>advanced mapping technologies</strong> and <strong>firsthand observations</strong>, we were able to carefully evaluate various aspects of the park and ultimately identify a <strong>well-suited location</strong> for our pavilion.</p>

                        <h1>Parametric Modeling</h1>
                        <p>It is important to transfer the idea in our brain to a digital model. After constructing the outline of the pivilion, I apply the parametric function of grasshopper to <strong>extent the basic plane</strong> and ramdonly make the set shape of the holes on it.</p>

                        <p>Making adjustment for the pivilion is relatively easy in the parameterized function. However, the one-piece design we used still cost me a lot of time adjusting the <strong>application area of the cutout</strong> in order to keep the cutout on the curved surface from overly twisting. </p>

                        <h1>Finalization & Branding</h1>
                        <p>Upon reaching a decision, I proceeded to implement the parametric cutout technique to the primary model of the pavilion. Subsequently, I made a model of a section of Holland Park, encompassing the neighboring roadways, with the exhibition hall serving as the focal point. This approach effectively showcased the design <strong>within its surrounding context</strong>. </p>

                        <p>Finally, our project was named "The Sunset." Additionally, I produced a commercial preview video that imbued a sense of experiential immersion, capturing the ambiance of individuals traversing the pavilion and seamlessly integrating it into a typical day at Holland Park.</p>

                    <p>Attention to detail is crucial: Creating a highly detailed and accurate 3D model requires a lot of attention to detail. From gathering reference materials to optimizing the model for use in Twinmotion, every step of the process required a high level of precision and care.</p>
                    <p>Technical skills are important: The project required a range of technical skills, including proficiency in Blender and Twinmotion. While these skills can be challenging to learn, they are essential for creating high-quality 3D models.</p>
                    <p>Overall, I found the experience of creating a 3D model for Holland Park to be a valuable learning opportunity. The project challenged me to develop new technical skills. The combination of Blender and Twinmotion allowed me to create a highly detailed and visually stunning 3D model of Holland Park that would serve as an excellent showcase for student work.</p>
