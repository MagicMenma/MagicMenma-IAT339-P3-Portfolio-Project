            <h1>The Sunside</h1>
            <p>Our <strong>IAT387 Directed Studies</strong> project involved designing a specialized breathing apparatus. Our team had skills and interests in visual, interactive, user experience design and 3D modeling in software <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>. Since our previous projects were usually dealt with in strict digital environments, we wanted this directed study project to explore the <strong>3D design field (industrial design)</strong> in a customer-facing project. Here's how we approached the project from start to finish.</p>
            <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Halil Erhan</p>
            <p><strong>Team Members:</strong><br><strong>Claire Yuan</strong> ( Researcher, Business Guru, Ideator,  Prototype Finishing Lead )<br> <strong>Kaixi Zhang</strong> ( Researcher, Visual Designer, Ideator, Prototype Assembly Lead)<br><strong>Qiaohui Xu</strong> ( Ideator, 3D Modelling God, Prototype Cutting & Trimming Lead )</p>

            <h1>Research & Ideation</h1>
            <p>We began by researching existing breathing apparatuses and their limitations. We also studied the medical conditions that require the use of breathing apparatuses and how they affect the patient's daily life.</p>
            
            <p>Based on our research, we brainstormed ideas for a new breathing apparatus that would address the limitations of existing devices. We sketched out several designs and discussed their feasibility.</p>

            <h1>Study the Context</h1>
            <p>To ensure a comprehensive understanding of the pavilion's context, we conducted an in-depth analysis of Holland Park. This involved examining its precise location, assessing the surrounding elements, built environments, access paths, traffic patterns, and noteworthy location features like landmarks, terrain characteristics, and orientation. Our analysis considered a wide range of factors to gain insights into the unique context of the pavilion within Holland Park.</p>
            
            <p>By leveraging the resources of the <a href="https://cosmos.surrey.ca/external/">City of Surrey Mapping Online System</a>, along with Google Earth's 3D data and conducting on-site field research, we conducted a detailed analysis of Holland Park. Through this process, we were able to carefully evaluate various aspects of the park and ultimately identify a well-suited location for our pavilion. The combination of advanced mapping technologies and firsthand observations allowed us to make an informed decision regarding the optimal placement of our pavilion within Holland Park.</p>

            <h1>User Testing & Finalizing the Design</h1>
            <p>We conducted user testing with users who require breathing apparatuses to gather feedback on the design's functionality and comfort. Based on the feedback, we made further adjustments to the design.</p>
            
            <p>Once we had a design that satisfied the user's needs, we finalized the design and created detailed 3D models and technical drawings for manufacturing.</p>

            <p>Our specialized breathing apparatus project showcases our ability to combine our skills in visual, interactive, and user experience design to create a product that addresses real-world problems. The project speaks to our ability to research, ideate, prototype, and iterate on a design until we achieve the desired outcome. My specific contribution to the project, including the digital 3D modeling and physical 3D printing of the prototypes, demonstrates my proficiency in 3D modeling and rapid prototyping techniques.</p>
