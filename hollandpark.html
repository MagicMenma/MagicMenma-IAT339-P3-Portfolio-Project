            <h1>Holland Park</h1>
            <p>For <strong>IAT233 Spatial Design</strong> final project demonstration, I collaborated with Professor Kenneth Zupan on a individual 3D modeling project named Holland Park. The project involved creating a detailed model of the Holland Park using software <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> and <a href="https://www.twinmotion.com">Twinmotion</a>. I explored the field of <strong>3D design field (scene modeling)</strong> in this project. Students in IAT233 could quickly exhibit their pavilion work on my sand table model.</p>

        <div class="projects_intro">
            <h1>Research & Data Collection</h1>
            <p>At the suggestion of Professor Kenneth, I learned more about Holland Park and began to collect data about the park. Accurate dimensional scale data is necessary to build the scene modeling, which not only helps to ensure the realism and credibility of the scene, but also improves the efficiency. Therefore, I spent a lot of time and effort to find and organize this data to ensure that I could move forward smoothly in the scene modeling process.</p>
            
            <p>The website <a href="https://cosmos.surrey.ca/external/">https://cosmos.surrey.ca/external/</a>, established by City of Surrey, provides a full range of data on Holland Park, including path, trees, buildings, roads, etc. Meanwhile, Google Maps and Google Earth provide street view, satellite images, 3D building images and 3D topographic images.</p>

            <h1>3D Modeling & UV Editing</h1>
            <p>Once I had gathered all the necessary reference materials, I began the modeling process. This involved creating a basic 3D model in Blender, which I could then refine and add detail to over time.</p>
            
            <p>As part of the modeling process, I also had to ensure that the model was properly UV mapped. This involves editing the UVs of the model so that materials can be applied correctly.UV editing can be a time-consuming process, but it's essential for creating high-quality 3D models. It allows for greater control over how textures are applied to the model, and can help to ensure that the final product looks as realistic as possible.</p>

            <h1>Scene Enrichment & Refinement</h1>
            <p>After completing the 3D model in Blender, I imported it into Twinmotion to further enhance the project. Twinmotion is a powerful real-time rendering software that adds textures, materials, and other visual elements to the 3D model.</p>
            
            <p>One of the first things I did in Twinmotion was to add texture maps to the model. This involved applying materials to various surfaces of the model, such as the walls of buildings, pavement, and grass. I also added plant and vegetation materials to the model to make it look more realistic and natural. Another important feature was the ability to add roads and driveways to the model. I created a detailed network of roads around the park to make the model more like a realistic environment.</p>

            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <p>Attention to detail is crucial: Creating a highly detailed and accurate 3D model requires a lot of attention to detail. From gathering reference materials to optimizing the model for use in Twinmotion, every step of the process required a high level of precision and care.</p>
            <p>Technical skills are important: The project required a range of technical skills, including proficiency in Blender and Twinmotion. While these skills can be challenging to learn, they are essential for creating high-quality 3D models.</p>
            <p>Overall, I found the experience of creating a 3D model for Holland Park to be a valuable learning opportunity. The project challenged me to develop new technical skills. The combination of Blender and Twinmotion allowed me to create a highly detailed and visually stunning 3D model of Holland Park that would serve as an excellent showcase for student work.</p>
